# Portfolio 2.0

## About project

This is my new portfolio page that I have built using powerful framework for React called Next.js. There are two reasons why I wanted to build a new portfolio page:
1. The design of the previous one was way too simple.
2. I wanted to learn more about Next.js.

This portfolio page is used to show all info that you might want to know about me regarding my skills, projects and etc.
